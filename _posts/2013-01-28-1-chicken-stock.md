We use a lot of broth in our house.  From soups to braises to sauces to reheating leftovers,
broth (especially the chicken variety) is an essential part of how we do business in the
kitchen. But it isn’t stock. What’s the difference? Gelatin. Stock has it, broth doesn’t
(not much, anyway).

Gelatin gives soups and sauces body. It makes them feel richer and fuller on the tongue.
You can always add gelatin to a dish (in fact, unflavored powdered gelatin is one of our
secret weapons in the kitchen), but it just isn’t the same. Keep this stock on hand and put
some real backbone into your food.

## Better for your Bottom Line

An even more compelling reason to make your own stock is that it will save you money and
help you make the most of the food that you are buying.  Broth is expensive and is a major
component of dishes like soup where you will need a lot of it. More importantly for our
household is that it let’s us make use of chicken carcasses.

Several years ago, we switched from buying our chicken piecemeal to buying whole birds.
Sure, there are recipes for which you just want the breasts, thighs or wings. But more
commonly, we just want chicken—any chicken—to make a meal with. So every week, we pick up
a bird. To give you an idea of the cost savings of buying whole, one roasting bird will
costs us $7-$12 dollars, depending on where we buy and the quality. Compare that to a
couple of split chicken breasts, which can easily run $10 or more.  The savings is huge,
especially if you use all of the bird.

For convenience, we’ll often get a pre-roasted chicken from the grocery store, have it
for a meal and then pick the carcass clean for leftovers and chicken salad.  We will also
buy a raw bird for a roast chicken dinner, or break it down piece by piece for use in meals.

However we do it, we are left with all sorts of inedible or undesirable bits of the
chicken: spines, ribs, cartilage, skin, leg bones, wings, etc. This recipe gives us a
great way to use these bits and save money in the process.  We put the carcass pieces in
a plastic bag and stow them in the fridge or freezer (depending on when we’ll be making
stock).  From there, they can go straight into the pot when we’re ready to start cooking.

This is also a great way to use the less desirable pieces of your vegetables.  While we
usually have some soon-to-be-rotten carrots, onions, celery or herbs around when we make
stock, you can also plan ahead and save otherwise inedible pieces of vegetables to be
used for stock.  Carrot peels, outer layers or stumps of onion, stumps of garlic cloves,
tops and bottoms of celery stalks, stems from thyme, rosemary or parsley, etc.  The list
goes on and on.  Just make sure you don’t use anything too starchy (potatoes are out) and
that there isn’t any dirt or paper on the veggies you use.

The most expensive ingredients in this recipe are peppercorns and bay leaves, both of
which are nice, but totally optional.  Without these ingredients, you can make a
beautiful, rich chicken stock with only ingredients considered garbage by most people.
Think of it as in-house recycling!

## Ingredients

* 1 whole chicken carcass, either roasted or raw
* 1 whole large onion, outermost layer and roots removed, quartered
* 2 carrots, broken in pieces
* 2 stalks celery, broken in pieces
* 2 clove garlic, smashed
* 3-5 stems of thyme, whole
* 5-10 peppercorns (optional)
* 1 bay leaf (optional)
* 5-10 whole corriander (optional)

Bones and pieces of chicken carcasses are fine, just make sure you have roughly the same
amount as a whole chicken carcass picked clean.  If you use the skin of the chicken,
make sure it isn’t too brown or burnt or covered in too much herbs or spices.  Discard
the skin if you are unsure.

Pieces of vegetables and herbs are also fine, but again make sure you have roughly the
same amount as 1 onion, 2 carrots, 2 stalks celery, 2 cloves garlic and a few whole stems
of thyme.  Spices can be omitted or changed up as you see fit.

## Get (Slowly) Simmering

Put the chicken carcass in the bottom of a 4 quart pot. A deep and tall pot is better
than a shallow and wide pot. Try to spread the carcass as evenly as possible on the bottom
of the pot. Put the veggies, herbs and spices on top of the chick.

Fill the pot nearly to the top with ice cold tap water.  Put over medium high heat,
uncovered, and bring to a gentle simmer.  Immediately reduce heat to low.  You are trying
to achieve a bare simmer where the top of the liquid is steaming and only a bubble or two
a second is breaking the surface of the water.

Continue to simmer for 6-8 hours.  During the coarse of simmering, you’ll need to
replenish the liquid occasionally.  Before replenishing the liquid, skim the surface of
fat or protein/foam.  Then add cold tap water to bring the water level back to where it
started and re-raise the temperature of the water over medium high heat before reducing
the heat back to low.

To be sure the stock is done, remove a bone from the liquid and see how brittle it is.
If it easily breaks, you know you’ve taken everything you can from the bones and the
stock is ready.

Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a large bowl. Then put the stock directly into
a tupperware container for freezing or refrigerating. Don’t wait for the stock to cool
before putting it into the refrigerator.  Stock will last a week in the fridge and
months in the freezer.

## Get Realistic

Not everyone has 6 hours to make this recipe.  I certainly don’t, at least not every
time I make it.  But even an hour or two of simmering will extract a terrific amount of
chicken and vegetable flavor.  You won’t get the amazing gelatin qualities of a true
stock with a short simmer, but it will still beat the pants off anything you could get
in the store.

I’ll often make stock right after an afternoon shopping trip or early evening family
meal.  That will leave me with roughly 3-5 hours to make this recipe.  In that case,
I’ll just let it simmer until I’m ready to go to bed, then strain it and pop it in
the fridge.

Is it perfect? No. But it is really tasty.
