I love making my own recipes. I cast a wide net over the internet and my cookbooks, come
back with dozens of techniques and ideas, and put together a dish that, ideally, is
better (or at least different) than any of the original recipes were.

Ideally.

A lot can go wrong. And it often will. But given enough attempts and tweaking, I can
usually turn out something worth eating.

Sometimes, though, a food is just so well understood, it’s techniques so tried and
true, the recipe variations so fully explored, that I can skip this whole process. When
people have done all of the legwork for you and the resulting recipes are all over the
internet, why not use them?

Take the humble baguette. It’s not that making baguettes is simple. And master bakers can
turn out baguettes that are much, much nicer than any I’ve created in my kitchen. But
I’m not sure I have anything to add to the basic baguette recipe. The techniques are
simple (if not more than a bit laborious) and the process is well understood.

So for baguettes, I put my trust in the recipes of others. My favorite is King Arthur
Flour’s recipe. It is detailed and precise, uses a starter to reduce rise times while
maintaining great flavor, and turns out terrific baguettes.

Oh, and they have a baker’s hotline that you can call if you are uncertain or their recipe
isn’t turning out. Pretty neat.
