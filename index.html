            Hi, my name is Matthew Trumbell. I live with my family 
            in Chicago, IL, in the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=lakeview,+chicago,+il&hl=en&sll=41.833733,-87.731964&sspn=0.709082,1.447449&hnear=Lake+View,+Chicago,+Cook,+Illinois&t=m&z=14">Lakeview</a> neighborhood.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like technology quite a lot and do quite a lot of 
            coding / designing / hacking in my free time. That is
            also how I make my living.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can frequently be found working with food and picking 
            my guitars. Or building container gardens. Or any number
            of other frivolous but emmensely fulfilling hobbies, really.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm currently working on a system that attempts to 
            squeeze a few more hours into my days. It isn't 
            going well.
          </p>

          <h1>Career</h1>
          <p>
            I have over a decade of experience building complex
            server side software with intuitive and easy to use
            clients. I've worked with many different architecture 
            styles and with many codebases, but I gravitate toward
            lightweight, modular systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've spent most of my career working in Python, C#, C 
            and HTML/Javascript. I also have considerable experience
            with Java, C++ and database technologies such as
            PostgresQL and MongoDB. Django has been my web framework 
            of choice for the last 5 years or so.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of my career has been spent creating risk management
            systems and models for financial derivatives trading. This
            is my specialty and it's an incredibly engaging problem set
            to work on.
          </p>
          <p>
            My resume is available online:
            <ul>
              <li><a href="">PDF Format</a></li>
              <li><a href="">Word Format</a></li>
