      <p>
        I'm an engineer that loves to create great software. I also
        lead teams that deliver incredible things. Technology has never
        stopped amazing me and I'm incredibly lucky to get paid to
        immerse myself in that world every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also have a number of other interests (mostly in
        technology / food / music) and I enjoy writing about them,
        <a href="/blog/">here</a> and on
        <a href="https://twitter.com/mtrums/">twitter</a>.

        I live in the

        neighborhood of Chicago with one incredible woman, one
        super child and two of the best cats you'll meet.

      <h1>Career</h1>
      <p>
        I have over a decade of experience building complex
        server side software with intuitive and easy to use
        clients. I've worked with many different architecture 
        styles and with many codebases, but I gravitate toward
        lightweight, modular systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've spent most of my career working in Python, C#, C 
        and HTML/Javascript. I also have considerable experience
        with Java, C++ and database technologies such as
        PostgreSQL and MongoDB. Django has been my web framework
        of choice for a number of years, though I enjoy dabbling
        with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have worked in financial technology for much of my
        career, solving many interesting problems along the way.
        I have designed and implemented many risk management systems
        and models for financial derivatives trading. This
        is my specialty and it's an incredibly engaging problem set
        to work on.
