title: "My Trouble with Wireless"
tags: Wireless Networking Apple
---

The wiring in our house is broken. Sure, there's Cat5 and coax in the walls, but it doesn't work.
The network of coax is split with a cheap, signal-degrading splitter hidden somewhere behind the
drywall and the Cat5 has a couple of bad twisted pairs. I intend to fix all of this (some day), but
in the meantime I'm leaning on wireless to connect all of the computers and devices in the house.

Until recently, this didn't work out very well. In the right conditions the wireless worked well,
but things fell apart far too frequently. Devices would frequently have problems with connectivity.
One minute everything would be fine, the next connectivity would slow to a crawl. Not just to the 
internet, either, but device to device. Just as bad were the "dead spots", areas of the house where,
though your device would show full bars, you just couldn't get any connectivity.

Determined to fix the problem, I turned to the internet for answers.

## "This was supposed to be the best!"

When I originally bought my router, an Asus RT-N66U, it was widely touted as one of the best available.
One of my most trusted internet sources, The Wirecutter, recommends it's successor, the Asus
RT-AC56U, as their favorite. And most reviews online were positive, getting positive marks in range,
in particular.

But then cracks started to appear. The Wirecutter 
[said to hold off on buying it](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-wi-fi-router/) due to "severe
connectivity issues on its 2.4Ghz band." Reports of problems, not unlike the problems I was
experiencing on my network, began to surface in reviews of the device. It turns out this well 
reviewed, well liked router had issues. "Just update the firmware!" said the proponents of these
Asus routers. I did. It didn't seem to help at all. Ultimately, I'm not sure whether my problem
was the same as the problems decribed all over the web, but I do know that my router didn't work
well. I needed an alternative.

The Wirecutter has tentatively recommended the Netgear R6250 as their new best, but I was skeptical.
I've had very poor experiences with Netgear's home network gear in the past, particularly their
routers.

## Turning to Apple

I know a couple of very happy Airport Extreme owners, but I was skeptical of the device. It gets
[poor reviews on range and throughput at distance](http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless/wireless-reviews/32158-apple-airport-extreme-80211ac-reviewed?start=3)
and they are more expensive than the competition, coming in easily $50 more than the Asus or
Netgear routers. On the other hand, I know Apple hardware: they build solid products which I've
rarely had problems with and their customer service has always been top notch.

Sick of dealing with my bad wireless performance with my Asus and not liking the recommended
alternatives, I pulled the trigger on the $300 Airport Time Capsule. It was a really good decision.

My dead spots vanished. Devices stopped randomly disconnecting and losing connectivity. The
communication between my iPhone and Apple TV has never felt so smooth.

## Trapped by Apple

One question that's been running through my head since before I made this switch is whether
Apple's products just play better together. If I have mostly Apple devices on my network, will
an Apple network perform better at keeping everything connected? I doubt there's a technical 
reason for this to be true. WiFi technologies are standards, after all, and my Apple
devices work just fine in a variety of other WiFi scenarios.
